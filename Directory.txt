// Yeah in server.js i think with all the definitons of "roud","norm", and "nest"]
// So I then assume that I could create special maze properties for the factory.
// "norm" is normal polygons, no special features
// "nest" is the pentagon nests with crashers
// "roid" are rocks, those grey polygons that block bullets/movement
// "wall" are blocks to create a maze. AI *may* get stuck on them. try disabeling 
// "dead" is an area devoid of polygons, an "ecological dead zone" so to speak. Bosses spawn in these zones and move to "boss" zones
// "boss" is a region bosses move to once they spawn, to give a heatmap with challenge depending on the zone
// "droi" is is just Roid with no shape spawns. I dont think that roids can spawn shapes but may be nessecary
